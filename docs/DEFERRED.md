## Mid-end `simplify` rule proofs (decided 2026-09-28)

**Decision (owner):** don't block the end-to-end theorem on proving every mid-end rule. The
end-to-end theorem is delivered for the **proven-rules configuration** (`Opt.Config.ruleAllow :=
.proven`, CLI `--opt-proven-only`). Only allow-listed rules contribute rewrites. More rules become
available by proving them and adding them to the allow-list; the theorems don't change.

**Exists (main):**
- Rule data: `Isle.Opt.program`, 1605 rules. E-closure: `Isle.Opt.Closure`, 1357 rules / 1193 roots (1156 `simplify`, 37 `simplify_skeleton`).
- Framework: `RuleOk`, `SimplifyRulesCorrect`, multi-term interpreter soundness, `simplifySound`, the skeleton framework, `simplifySound_proven`, `skeletonSound_proven`.
- Allow-list: `Opt.provenSimplifyRules`, `RuleAll.simplifyRulesCorrect_proven`.
- Template tactics and the generated constructor lemmas.
- The exact proven set and the per-family recipe are in `docs/contracts/midend.md`, section "Rule proofs".

**Status (2026-10-01, RulesRest):** 1012 `simplify` roots are proven and allow-listed: arithmetic 216 of 258, cprop 61 of 68, bitops 444 of 450, icmp 95 of 124, selects 82 of 100, extends 26 of 29, shifts 56 of 75, spaceship 20 of 40 and remat 12 of 12. The skeleton allow-list is empty. `E2E.backend_correct_opt_proven` covers exactly this set. With only these rules enabled, corpus instructions fall from 4668 to 2322 (was 2605 at 936 roots), and runtests from 3389 to 2976 (was 2993).

**Findings:** `shifts.isle` 84 and 88 are false under the CLIF semantics (shift constants above the type width make `shift_amt_to_type` pick a type wider than `ty`, so the rule builds an ill-typed `ireduce`/`sextend`; midend.md has the example). No skeleton rule can be proven against the current `SkelRuleOk`: the matched operand nodes are facts about the start state, while the refinement is checked in later valuations, and `GraphModel` does not keep a class's nodes across states. Proving skeleton rules (including `div_const`) needs node persistence in `GraphModel` (or a defined-operands premise in `SkelRuleOk`), which changes the pass proofs' obligations.

**Remaining:** arithmetic 42, cprop 7, bitops 6, icmp 29, selects 18, extends 3, shifts 19 (2 of them false), spaceship 20, skeleton 37 (blocked, see above). midend.md lists them with reasons. Roots per family:

| Family | Roots |
| --- | --- |
| bitops | 450 |
| arithmetic | 258 |
| icmp | 124 |
| selects | 100 |
| shifts | 75 |
| cprop | 68 |
| spaceship | 40 |
| extends | 29 |
| remat | 12 (all proven) |
| skeleton (incl. div_const) | 37 |

**How to add a family:** follow the recipe in midend.md "Rule proofs":
1. Write a per-family file with `RuleOk` proofs over an abstract `p` with `Data p`.
2. Add the rule ids to `Opt.provenSimplifyRules` (`FV/Opt/RuleAllow.lean`) and import the new file in `FV/Opt/Proof/RuleAll.lean` (a skeleton rule needs `ok_rule_X : SkelRuleOk p rule_X`).
3. Run `scripts/opt-difftest.sh` with `--opt-proven-only` and record how many instructions the proven subset removes.

Families are independent and can run in parallel, one agent per opts file.

**Also deferred in the mid-end** (from midend.md "Gaps"):
- alias analysis (redundant-load elimination, store-to-load forwarding);
- merging identical trapping instructions;
- elaboration-based sinking and general rematerialisation;
- full e-class visibility for later matches.

## i128 legalisation: what `E2E.backend_correct_legal` does not cover (2026-09-30)

Legalised `i128` functions are inside the end-to-end theorem (`E2E.backend_correct_legal`,
`docs/contracts/legalize128.md`; survey 31 and runtests 159 functions reported verified).
Deferred:
- composing the legalisation with the mid-end theorems (`--opt` keeps legalised functions
  unverified);
- runs that trap inside a `__*ti3` helper (`i128` division by zero, `sdiv MIN, -1`): the
  backend theorem excludes extern traps (`TrapsExplicit` of the legalised run); covering them
  needs a trapping-helper contract on the Arm side (natively the helper aborts);
- a correct `umulhi`/`smulhi` expansion at `i128` (now unsupported), `try_call` with `i128`
  in the validator, `i128` overflow ops and atomics, stack-passed `i128` arguments.

## `sret`: what `E2E.backend_correct_final` does not cover (2026-09-30)

Functions with a struct-return pointer and calls of `sret` callees are inside the end-to-end
theorem (`docs/contracts/e2e.md`, "`sret`"). Deferred:
- the conclusion claims the CLIF return values (none for an `sret` function) and the memory the
  function wrote through the pointer, not that x0 holds the pointer on return (the ABI's
  `sigRets`); callers compiled by cg_clif and the Lean backend do not read it;
- `vmctx`/`sarg` parameters (flagged unverified). (`sret` with 8 further parameters is
  covered since agent/stack-tls-proof: `InSubset.regParams` is gone.)

## Stack-passed arguments: what `E2E.backend_correct_final` does not cover (2026-10-01)

Stack-passed parameters and stack-passed arguments of `call` are inside the end-to-end theorem
(`docs/contracts/e2e.md`, "Stack-passed parameters and `call` arguments"). Deferred:
- stack-passed arguments of a `try_call` (`InSubset.tryRegArgs`, flagged unverified) and of
  `call_indirect`/`try_call_indirect` (`InSubset.indSigs`, at most 8 register parameters);
- the callee contract `XCallsOk` relates the world the callee returns by `Rel.holds`, including
  `OutRel` of the caller's outgoing area; that the callee does not touch live CLIF memory in it
  is part of the environment contract, not derived from AAPCS64.

- **M3b** (Lean-optimised vs Cranelift-optimised CLIF comparison): optional, not started.
- **DSL `compile_correct` (M2):** paused on branch `agent/m2proof`.
- **Rust route extras:** data objects via a cg_clif fork, panic/`mem*` contracts, `dyn`. See `docs/research/rust-clif-survey.md`.
- **After M7 (PLAN.md):** SIMD, RISC-V, a verified frontend.
